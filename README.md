Basic Cryptography
==================
#Purpose

To decrpyt bytes with a key using subroutines.

#Hardware Schematic

Simply the board connected to the computer.

#Debugging

After making corrections in the debugging mode, you need to terminate the program and run the Debug again so the changes take effect.

Had a problem with labels, can't include spaces, and there has to be a label if you have a jump to one.

#Testing Methedology/Results

I created the program in modules. First, I created a loop to check which operation the program had then jump to that specific operand instruction. Registers 5 and 6 included myProgram and memory. 7, 8, and 9 are the first operation, operand, then second operation. 10 stores the result. Required functionality and B functionality worked and were checked. 

#Observations/Conclusions

The first A functionality could have been achieved by making a loop and like 3rd grade math, adding a number to another number that many times. Ex. 4 x 3 = 4 + 4 + 4. I tried to go for the harder A functionality using shift-adds to multiply but I'm not sure why my program doesn't work.

#Documentation: 
I added more to my flow chart after Dr York checked it and commented on expanding the operations. Also, Dr York explained how to shift and add to create a multiplier that would achieve A functionality.
